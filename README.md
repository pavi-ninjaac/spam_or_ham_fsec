# Improvements:
- Get more data to train the models.
- Try better Data augmentation techniques, like GAN for generate more data.
- Can try fine-tuning LLMs if we have text as input.
- Since we have very less amount of data, even very complex DL models are just overfitting the data. ***Generate or collect more data.***

From clean code perspective:
- Need to handle exceptions more gracefully.
